============

This was the first attempt at making a game back when I first started learning programming.
keep in mind that this game runs in windows shell and executes batch commands so it will only work on windows machines unfortunately.
I still look back at this sometimes and it reminds me what an aweful programmer I was.
But you have to start somewhere. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
